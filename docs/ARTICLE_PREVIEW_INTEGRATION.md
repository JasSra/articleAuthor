# Article Preview Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated the ArticlePreviewModal component into the main articles dashboard, enabling users to quickly preview article content without navigating to a separate page.

## Implementation Details

### 1. ArticlePreviewModal Component (`/components/ArticlePreviewModal.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Provides a modal overlay for quick article content preview
- **Features**:
  - Loads article content dynamically using the API client
  - Displays formatted article metadata (title, author, dates, status)
  - Renders markdown content with proper formatting
  - Includes action buttons for edit, bookmark, and share
  - Responsive design with proper accessibility attributes
  - Loading states and error handling

- **Props Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface ArticlePreviewModalProps {
    articleId: string | null;
    isOpen: boolean;
    onClose: () => void;
    onEdit?: (articleId: string) => void;
    onBookmark?: (articleId: string) => void;
    isBookmarked?: boolean;
  }
  ```

### 2. Dashboard Integration (`/app/articles/page.tsx`)

#### State Management
- Added `previewArticleId` state to track which article is being previewed
- Modal visibility controlled by checking if `previewArticleId` is not null

#### Preview Triggers
**Grid View**:
- Added preview button to card actions section
- Styled as small button with eye icon and "Preview" text
- Positioned between bookmark and edit buttons

**List View**:
- Added preview button to article actions
- Displays as eye icon button for compact layout
- Maintains consistency with other action buttons

#### Modal Implementation
- Positioned at the end of the component tree
- Conditional rendering based on `previewArticleId` state
- Integrated with existing bookmark functionality
- Auto-navigation to edit page for drafts

### 3. Event Handlers

#### Preview Modal Handlers
```typescript
// Open preview
onClick={() => setPreviewArticleId(article.id)}

// Close preview
onClose={() => setPreviewArticleId(null)}

// Edit integration
onEdit={(id) => {
  setPreviewArticleId(null);
  const article = articles.find(a => a.id === id);
  if (article?.status === 'draft') {
    window.location.href = `/submit?edit=${id}`;
  }
}}

// Bookmark integration
onBookmark={(id) => {
  toggleBookmark(id);
}}
```
